# Claude Memory System - Overview

## Introduction

The Claude Memory System is designed to provide persistent memory capabilities across conversations by combining in-session knowledge graph functionality with filesystem persistence.

## Components

### Memory Manager

The core component responsible for reading, writing, and updating memory files. It serves as the primary interface between the knowledge graph and the file system.

### Knowledge Graph

Provides an abstraction over the MCP server-memory functionality, allowing for the creation and management of entities and relationships during a session.

### Memory Compression

Implements algorithms for compressing related observations into more concise representations, improving token efficiency and managing memory growth over time.

## Memory Structure

The memory system uses a hierarchical approach to organize information:

### Short-term Memory

- Recent observations and interactions
- Detailed, specific information
- Active session knowledge

### Long-term Memory

- Compressed observations from previous sessions
- General patterns and preferences
- Persistent user information

## Memory Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Read memory file and initialize knowledge graph
2. **Information Gathering**: Collect observations during conversation
3. **Relation Building**: Create connections between entities
4. **Compression**: Condense related short-term memories
5. **Persistence**: Write updated memory to file system

## Future Directions

- Enhanced compression algorithms
- Semantic similarity for better retrieval
- Adaptive importance scoring
- Memory visualization tools
